# Angular2
Angular 2 Quickstart example

# Requisites
You must have npm installed:
[Install node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

I'm using:
```
$ node -v
v6.2.0

$ npm -v
3.9.3
```
Be sure to upgrade version and packages before the next step or it will explode ;)

# Start
Clone this repository and once inside run :
```
$ npm install
```

Once node_modules and typings folders created just run:
```
$ npm start
```
